\section{Up-Scaling NFR}

The axial stress-strain data was taken to be the most indicative of the material response and thus used for the parameter estimation datasets.


A total of nine parameters were identified as being essential to the definition of the CDM material model. The elastic behavior of the rock mass was described using two parameters, Young’s Modulus, and Poisson’s Ratio, while 5 additional parameters were used to describe the plastic behavior of the rock mass in both tension and compression. The remaining two parameters describe the damage evolution in tension and compression respectively.
