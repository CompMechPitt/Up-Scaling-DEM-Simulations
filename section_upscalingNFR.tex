\section{Up-Scaling NFR Simulations}

The axial stress-strain data was taken to be the most indicative of the material response and thus used for the parameter estimation datasets.


A total of nine parameters were identified as being essential to the definition of the CDM material model. The elastic behavior of the rock mass was described using two parameters, Young’s Modulus, and Poisson’s Ratio, while 5 additional parameters were used to describe the plastic behavior of the rock mass in both tension and compression. The remaining two parameters describe the damage evolution in tension and compression respectively.

Up-scaling the NFR DEM simulations was conducted by running a series of compression tests under different confining stresses and unloading the before ultimate failure. This unloading allows for an accurate characterization of the damage response of the material.
