\subsection{DNS Comparison}

A qualitative comparison of the stress distribution and the surface deflection at a point just before failure was conducted between the DEM model and the CDM model. For the DEM solution, since the stress field was discontinuous, the stress fields were smoothed using a cubic spline interpolation and subsequently run through a Gaussian filter with a standard deviation of 2. The Gaussian filter is a convolution operation that was used to reduce the noise in the data set. Figures \ref{fig:S11DNS}, \ref{fig:S22DNS}, and \ref{fig:S12DNS} show the horizontal stress distributions, the vertical stress distributions, and the shear stress distributions, respectively.
