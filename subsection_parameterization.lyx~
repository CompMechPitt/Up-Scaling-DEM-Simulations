Model Parameterization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The CDM model used in this investigation is the concrete damaged plasticity
 model that is implemented in ABAQUS, which is based on the plastic-damage
 model for concrete proposed by Lubliner et al.
 (1989) and further developed by Lee and Fenves (1998) for cyclic loading.
 The general CDM theory considers the stiffness degradation of the material
 by modifying the elastic stiffness tensor with a damage variable.
 The damage variable can be scalar or tensorial in nature, depending on
 the anisotropy of damage evolution.
 In this investigation, the isotropic case is considered and so a scalar
 damage variable becomes sufficient.
 The parameters of the CDM that were calibrated from DEM simulations characteriz
e the elastic and the plastic behavior and the damage evolution.
 Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio parameterize the elastic behavior.
 The plastic behavior of the material is largely determined by the parameters
 of the hardening rule, and different functions were used to characterize
 hardening in tension and compression.
 The shape of the curves were based on the laboratory data in Wahalathantri
 et al.
 (2011) and the aim was to mimic the curves with the least number of parameters.
 The compressive hardening rule,
\begin_inset Formula $,$
\end_inset

 was approximated using a quadratic function, as shown in Fig 3.
 The quadratic function requires three parameters.
 It was found to be useful to manipulate the standard quadratic equation
 form to allow for the three parameters to have a physical meaning.
 This form of the approximation becomes quite useful for the parameter estimatio
n when applying bounding limits: Ïc (Îµ Ìin )=(Ïciy-Ïcp)/(Îµcpp )2 (Îµ
 Ìin-Îµcpp )2+Ïcp

Fig 3 Compressive hardening rule for the CDM model using three parameters
 for a quadratic approximation.
 Here, the compressive yield stress, Ïc, is written as function of the
 inelastic strain, Îµ Ìin, and three additional parameters.
 The three parameters are the initial compressive yield stress (Ïciy),
 the peak compressive yield stress (Ïcp), and the plastic strain at the
 peak compressive yield stress (Îµcpp).
 The physical significance of each of these parameters can be seen in Fig
 3, where they define the y-intercept and the peak of the curve.
 The tensile hardening rule has a fundamentally different behavior than
 the compressive hardening rule, and was therefore approximated using an
 exponential function (Fig 4).
 The exponential function required only two parameters to characterize the
 curve completely.
 The first parameter was the initial tensile yield stress, Ïtiy, which
 defines the y-intercept of the curve, while the second parameter was the
 tensile yield stress decay parameter, Î».
 These parameters describe the relationship between the tensile yield stress,
 Ït, and the cracking strain, Îµ Ìck, and has the form: Ït (Îµ Ìck )=Ïtiy
 e(Î»Îµ Ìck )

Fig 4 Tensile hardening rule for the CDM model using two parameters for
 an exponential approximation.
 In addition to the hardening rules, the damage evolution equations must
 also be parameterized.
 The compressive damage, Dc, is assumed to be a linear function of the inelastic
 strain through a compressive damage rate parameter, m: Dc (Îµ Ìin )=Îµ
 Ìin m The tensile damage (Dt) evolution is slightly less trivial, but
 can also be characterized by a single parameter due to some constraints
 imposed on the function by the nature of the damage parameter.
 In tension, the damage evolution curve starts at the origin and asymptotically
 approaches Dt=1 as Îµ Ìckââ.
 As such, under this functional assumption, the only parameter required
 to describe this relationship is the tensile damage rate parameter, n:
 Dt (Îµ Ìck )=1-1/(1+Îµ Ìck )n Sample damage evolution curves for both
 tension and compression are illustrated in Fig 5, where one can see that
 the rate at which the tensile damage evolves is far larger than the rate
 at which the compressive damage evolves.
 The combination of the elastic parameters, the hardening rule parameters,
 and the damage evolution parameters, yield a total of nine parameters that
 must be identified by experiments or through up-scaling to define the behavior
 of CDM model.
