\subsection{Damage-Plasticty Model For Quasi-Brittle Materials}

This damage-plasticity model was developed by \citet{lubliner_plastic-damage_1989} as a plasticity based damage model for non-linear analysis of concrete failure. Subsequently, \citet{lee_plastic-damage_1998} further developed the model to facilitate cyclic loading by adding a second damage variable and introducing a new yield function to account for the additional damage variable. 

This model was specifically formulated for modeling quasi-brittle materials under low confining stresses subject to cyclic loading. In addition to the separate damage variables governing the stiffness degradation, the stiffness recovery and material hardening/softening is also treated separately in both compression and tension. Because the formulation does not consider the effects of large hydrostatic stresses, the applicability of this plastic to in-situ geomechanics
at depth may not be sufficiently accurate. As such, this model is more appropriate for shallow geological models that require cyclic loading paths to be considered.
