\section{ModelParameterization}
parameterization of the material models is essential to effective upscaling of the system. parameterization needs to be conducted in susch a way as to minimize the number of parameters, while still yeilding a sufficiently accurate response. in addition, it is ideal, but not necessary for the parameters to have physical meaning in order to specify realistic bounds with less difficulty.
