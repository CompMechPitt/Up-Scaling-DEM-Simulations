\begin_layout Section
Homogenization Approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main objective of homogenizing DEM simulations is to be able to describe
 the macroscopic behavior of the discontinuous medium in terms of a standard
 more computationally efficient continuum model.
 The homogenization algorithms used herein are based on the methods developed
 by (DâAddetta et al., 2004) and (Wellmann et al., 2008).
 In this homogenization process, the resultant inter-block contact forces
 and block displacement from the DEM simulations are converted to average
 stresses and strains for a continuum.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the homogenization procedure to yield meaningful results, it should
 be applied to a REV.
 The exact size of the REV depends on the geometry and mechanical properties
 of the DEM model.
 For the homogenization approach to hold, the REV of size 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 within a system with a characteristic length 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 and consisting of blocks with a characteristic diameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

, must subscribe to the following scale separation (Wellmann et al., 2008).
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
D\gg d\gg\delta\label{eqn:hom1a}
\end{equation}

% To avoid a lengthy discussion of the statistics required to formally define
 an REV for a particular DFN, an REV is assumed for the purposes of this
 investigation.
 The REV is chosen to be a circular subsection of the DEM model.
 This representative subsection aims to be as large as possible, while being
 a sufficiently small REV so as to reduce the influence of boundary effects.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
*Given a circular REV, due to the discontinuous nature of the DEM simulations,
 the circular REV cannot be used directly.
 Because the calculated displacements and contact forces from the DEM are
 known at the block edges, the homogenization domain boundary must follow
 the block boundaries.
 In order to define a homogenization domain based on the REV, but subscribing
 to the block boundaries, the homogenization domain is taken to be the domain
 defined by the outside boundaries of the blocks that intersect the REV
 boundary, as illustrated in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:vorDFN"

\end_inset

.
 The homogenization domain is characterized by a series of block corners
 which are identified for the initial (zero strain) state.
 These corners continue to define the homogenization domain once deformation
 occurs, allowing for a consistent homogenization domain definition as the
 model is deformed.
 The algorithm that was developed to assess the homogenization domain boundary
 is presented as follows:

This algorithm for defining the homogenization domain was developed to provide
 an unambiguous method for assessing a unique homogenization domain for
 a given circle radius and location.
 In steps 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "hli:1"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "hli:2"

\end_inset

, two mutually exclusive block sets are identified, which necessarily share
 contacts.
 It is the boundary between these two block sets that is the homogenization
 domain boundary which is characterized by this algorithm.
 Ultimately, the goal of this process is to identify the corners on this
 boundary that are on the blocks that intersect with the REV boundary and
 not the blocks that are outside the REV boundary.
 As such, the corners (step 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "hli:4"

\end_inset

) corresponding to the contacts (step 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "hli:3"

\end_inset

) between the two sets of blocks are determined.
 Step 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "hli:5"

\end_inset

 is necessary to help eliminate some blocks from the set of boundary block
 which intersect the REV boundary, but only have contact with blocks inside
 the homogenization domain boundary, and thus do not have any overall contributi
on to the definition.
 Step 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "hli:6"

\end_inset

 determines this resultant set of boundary blocks of which every member
 is connected to the boundary in some capacity.
 Finding the set of corners that is mutually shared by these blocks in step

 and the boundary contact corners in step 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 allow for the determination of the initial set of boundary corners (step
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, one must also note the potential displacement jumps that may occur
 between blocks on the boundary as the model deforms.
 In the case where the blocks become physically separated, there exists
 a discontinuity along the homogenization boundary as can be seen in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:vorDFN"

\end_inset

.
 These discontinuities along the homogenization boundary were considered
 by adding boundary segments to the homogenization boundary between the
 corners of the adjacent blocks.
 As such, steps 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "hli:9"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "hli:10"

\end_inset

 find coincident corners on adjacent boundary blocks to allow for the blocks
 to become separated on the boundary, while still maintaining connectivity
 along the homogenization domain boundary.
 It is also necessary to order the corners (step 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "hli:11"

\end_inset

) as they would appear along the homogenization boundary in order to define
 the boundary segments along which integration can be performed.

\begin_layout Standard
The homogenization boundary, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{h}$
\end_inset

, can be described in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 ordered boundary vertices, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{i}^{h}=(x_{i}^{h},y_{i}^{h})$
\end_inset

, representing the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

th set of vertex coordinates along the boundary, such that the homogenization
 area, 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{h}$
\end_inset

, can be calculated using the following formulation for the area of an arbitrary
, non-self-intersecting polygon(find reference): 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
A^{h}=\dfrac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{h}(y_{i+1}^{h}-y_{i-1}^{h})\label{eqn:hom1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point, within the homogenization domain, one must differentiate
 between the blocks and the void space between the blocks as they have fundament
ally different behaviour.
 As such, the homogenization domain can be decomposed into two mutually
 exclusive subdomains representing the voids and blocks, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega^{v}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega^{b}$
\end_inset

, respectively.
 The total block area associated with the block subdomain, 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{b}$
\end_inset

, can be assessed as a summation of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 block areas within the homogenization domain, while the individual block
 area can be assessed in a similar manner to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eqn:hom1"

\end_inset

.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{j}$
\end_inset

 block boundary vertices, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{i,j}^{b}=(x_{i,j}^{b},y_{i,j}^{b})$
\end_inset

 representing the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

th set of vertex coordinates on the 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

th block, the total block area can be calculated as: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
A^{b}=\dfrac{1}{2}\sum_{j=0}^{m}\sum_{i=1}^{n_{j}}x_{i,j}^{b}(y_{i+1,j}^{b}-y_{i-1,j}^{b})\label{eqn:hom2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that the block domain and the void domain are jointly exhaustive
 of the total homogenization domain, the total area associated with the
 void subdomain, 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{v}$
\end_inset

, can be written as the difference of the homogenization domain area and
 the block subdomain area: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
A^{v}=A^{h}-A^{b}\label{eqn:hom3}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
A^{v}=\dfrac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{h}(y_{i+1}^{h}-y_{i-1}^{h})-\dfrac{1}{2}\sum_{j=0}^{m}\sum_{i=1}^{n_{j}}x_{i,j}^{b}(y_{i+1,j}^{b}-y_{i-1,j}^{b})\label{eqn:hom4}
