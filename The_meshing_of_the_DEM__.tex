The meshing of the DEM simulations is identical to the REV simulations for the parameter estimation, while the CDM model is meshed using 4-node bilinear plane strain elements.

The models in both DEM and FEM are allowed to find a static equilibrium after the gravity force is applied, then a linearly increasing compressive stress along the top of the slope is applied until the slope fails. The load is increased from $0MPa$ to $25 MPa$ over the course of $100s$ in the quasi-static/static simulations, knowing that the slope should fail long before $25MPa$ is reached.
