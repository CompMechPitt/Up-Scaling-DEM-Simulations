The meshing of the DEM simulations was identical to the REV simulations for the parameter estimation, while the CDM model was meshed using 4-node bilinear plane strain elements.

The models in both DEM and FEM were allowed to find a static equilibrium after the gravity force had been applied. Subsequently, a the linearly increasing compressive stress along the top of the slope was applied to see at what applied stress the slope fails. The load was increased from $0MPa$ to $25 MPa$ over the course of $100s$ in the quasi-static/static simulations with the knowledge that the slope should fail long before $25MPa$ is reached.
