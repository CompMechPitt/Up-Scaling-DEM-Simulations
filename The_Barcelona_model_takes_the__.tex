The tensile hardening rule has a fundamentally different behavior
than the compressive hardening rule, and was therefore approximated
using an exponential function (Fig \ref{fig:conctens}). The exponential function required
only two parameters to characterize the curve completely. The first
parameter was the initial tensile yield stress, $\sigma_{t}^{iy}$,
which defines the y-intercept of the curve, while the second parameter
was the tensile yield stress decay parameter,$\lambda$. These parameters
describe the relationship between the tensile yield stress, $\sigma_{t}$,
and the cracking strain, $\bar{\epsilon}^{ck}$, and has the form:

\begin{equation}
\sigma_{t}\left(\bar{\epsilon}^{ck}\right)=\sigma_{t}^{iy}e^{\lambda\bar{\epsilon}^{ck}}\label{eqn:param2}
\end{equation}
