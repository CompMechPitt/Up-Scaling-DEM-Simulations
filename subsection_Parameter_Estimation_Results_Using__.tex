\subsection{Parameter Estimation Results}

Using a PSO algorithm followed by an LMA optimization, the Drucker-Prager plasticity model with ductile damage was fitted to the post-yield DEM simulation data in order to obtain an optimal parameter set. Each simulation was fit to 50 evenly spaced (temporally) data points resulting in a total of 200 data points for all four DEM simulations at different confining stresses. The PSO algorithm was run with a swarm size of 24for 100 generations.

Parameter bounding limits are required by the optimization algorithms in order to limit the search space. These parameter values were chosen based on two criteria: physical limitations and numerical stability. If there existed physical limitations that prevent parameters from exceeding certain values or if there existed a range of realistic values that the parameter should not deviate from, then those physical limitations were specified as the bounds. In other cases, the parameter bounds came from numerical limitations such that beyond a certain capacity, certain parameter values would cause the simulations to become unstable. In these cases, a combination of the two bounding methods was used.  The specified results can be seen in Table \ref{tab:paramDrucker}.
