The interaction between $\Omega_i$ and $\Omega_j$ along $\Gamma_{ij}$ is the distinguishing feature in the DEM formulation, and is comprised of two main components: contact detection and the constitutive relationship. The contact detection algorithms are responsible for ensuring that $\Omega_i$ and $\Omega_j$ do not penetrate each other and ensuring that the appropriate contact forces are transferred between elements. These contact forces are governed by constitutive models of $\Gamma_{ij}$ which can be described in general by a shear stiffness, $k_s$, in a direction parallel to the $\Gamma_{ij}$, and a normal stiffness, $k_n$, in a direction normal to $\Gamma_i$. The normal stress over any $\Gamma_{ij}$, $\sigma^n$, can be expressed as a function of the normal elastic displacement, $u^n$, up until the tensile strength, $T$, is exceeded: 

\begin{equation}
\sigma^n=\left\{\begin{matrix}
\sigma^n\left(k^n, u^n\right) &if& \sigma^n \geq -T\\ 
 0 & if &\sigma^n < -T
\end{matrix}\right.
\label{eqn:demnormal}
\end{equation}

Futhermore, the shear stress, $\tau$, over any $\Gamma_{ij}$ can be written in terms of the elastic shear displacement, $u^s$, until the maximum shear strength, $\tau^{max}$ is reached. The point when the shear stress at a point on $\Gamma_{ij}$ exceeds the prescribed maximum shear stress, the discontinuity experiences plastic shear displacements in order not to exceed the maximum shear stress:

\begin{equation}
\ta=\left\{\begin{matrix}
\tau\left(k^s,u^s, \sigma^n\right) &if&\left |\tau \right | < \tau^{max}\\ 
\frac{u^s}{\left|u^s\right|}\tau^{max} & if &\left |\tau \right | \geq \tau^{max}
\end{matrix}\right.
\label{eqn:demshear}
\end{equation}

The microscale stress field, $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^m$, within $\Omega_i$ is described by standard continuum constitutive relationships. With the constitutive behaviour of the discontinuities and the constitutive behaviour of the continuum blocks, the overall behaviour of the rock mass can be characterized through material properties of the rock discontinuities and the intact rock.
