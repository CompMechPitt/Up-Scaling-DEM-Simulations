\subsection{Drucker-Prager Plasticity with Ductile Damage}

Elastic parameters are same as above. Young's Modulus and Poisson's
Ratio - 2 elastic parameters

The Drucker-Prager plasticity model can be written in terms of 4 individual
components: The friction angle, dilation angle, initial tensile strength,
and the hardening rule. The hardening rule assumes a functional form
in terms of a power law:

\begin{equation}
\sigma_{y}=A+B\left(\bar{\epsilon}^{pl}\right)^{n}\label{eqn:param5}
\end{equation}


This yields a total of 6 parameters for the plasticity characterization.
The damage characterization is comprised of two main components,
the damage initiation and the damage evolution. The damage initiation
is based on the Johnson-Cook model as follows: 

\begin{equation}
\bar{\epsilon}_{f}^{pl}\left(\eta\right)=\left[D_{1}+D_{2}e^{D_{3}\eta}\right]\label{eqn:param6}
\end{equation}
