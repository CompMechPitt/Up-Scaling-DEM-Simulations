\subsection{Drucker-Prager Plasticity with Ductile Damage}

The Drucker-Prager plasticity model can be written in terms of 4 individual
components: The friction angle, dilation angle, initial tensile strength,
and the hardening rule. The hardening rule assumes a functional form
in terms of a power law according to \cite{prantl_identification_2013}:


\begin{equation}
\sigma_{y}=A+B\left(\bar{\epsilon}^{pl}\right)^{n}
\end{equation}
