\subsection{Up-Scaling Computational Efficiency}

It was found that runnning the continuum models took an order of magnitude less computational effort.

\begin{tabular}{lllll}
Simulation Type & No. Continuum Elements & Processor Clock Rate & Slope Failure Load & Computational Time \\
DEM             & $25898$                & $2.20 GHz$           & $11.2 MPa$         & $46.5 hrs$         \\
CDM             & $29866$                & $1.80 GHz$           & $11.4 MPa$         & $0.65 hrs$
