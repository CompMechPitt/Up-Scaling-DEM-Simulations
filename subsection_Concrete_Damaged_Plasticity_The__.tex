\subsection{Concrete Damaged-Plasticity}
%The CDM model used in this investigation is the concrete damaged plasticity
%model that is implemented in ABAQUS, which is based on the plastic-damage
%model for concrete proposed by \citet{lubliner_plastic-damage_1989} and further
%developed by \citet{lee_plastic-damage_1998} for cyclic loading. The general
%CDM theory considers the stiffness degradation of the material by
%modifying the elastic stiffness tensor with a damage variable. The
%damage variable can be scalar or tensorial in nature, depending on
%the anisotropy of damage evolution. In this investigation, the isotropic
%case is considered and so a scalar damage variable becomes sufficient.

%The parameters of the CDM that were calibrated from DEM simulations
%characterize the elastic and the plastic behavior and the damage evolution.
%Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio parameterize the elastic behavior.
%For the concrete damaged-plasticity model, the plastic behavior of the material is largely determined by the
%parameters of the hardening rule. 
The yield function
\begin{equation}
\alpha = \frac{f_0-1}{2f_0-1}
\label{eqn:param1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\beta = \frac{\bar{\sigma}_c\left( \bar{\epsilon}^{pl}_c\right )}{\bar{\sigma}_t\left( \bar{\epsilon}^{pl}_t\right )}\left(1-\alpha \right )-\left( 1+\alpha \right)
\label{eqn:param1-2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\gamma = \frac{3\left(1-K_c \right)}{2K_c-1}
\label{eqn:param1-3}
\end{equation}


Different functions were used to characterize hardening in tension and compression. The shape of the curves were based on the laboratory data in \citet{wahalathantri_material_2011} and the aim was to mimic the curves with the least number of parameters. The compressive hardening rule, $\sigma_{c}\left(\bar{\epsilon}^{in}\right)$, was approximated using the Barcelona model as shown in Figure \ref{fig:conccomp}.
