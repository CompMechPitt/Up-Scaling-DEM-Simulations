\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, a framework for up-scaling DEM simulations is presented. Up-scaling is achieved by matching homogenized stress-strain curves from REV-scale DEM simulations to single element continuum models using PSO and DLS optimization algorithms. A Drucker-Prager plasticity model with ductile damage was implemented as the CDM model to empirically capture the effect of the degradation of the NFR.

It was found that the
