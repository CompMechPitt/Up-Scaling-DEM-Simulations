\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, a framework for up-scaling DEM simulations is presented. Up-scaling is achieved by matching homogenized stress-strain curves from REV-scale DEM simulations to single element continuum models using PSO and LMA optimization algorithms. A Drucker-Prager plasticity model with ductile damage was implemented as the CDM model to empirically capture the effect of the degradation of the NFR.

It was shown that the Drucker-Prager model with ductile damage was a reasonable CDM model to represent NFR in a continuum context due to the pressure dependent yield criterion and the triaxiality based damage initiation criterion. When fit to the DEM data, the CDM model showed a very good fit pre-damage, but wasn't able to capture some of the subtle oscillations post-yield to due discontinuous yielding in the NFR.

Most importantly, the DNS showed that with this up-scaling framework, very comparable results ($<5%$ error) to the DEM solution can be obtained with the CDM solution but with two to three orders of magnitude less computational time.

This formulation does have its limitations in that it is only formulated for small strains, it is a purely mechanical formulation, and only 2D is considered. However, the framework is exactly the same for the large strain case, the hydro-mechanically coupled case, and the 3D case. Just the software modules need to be replaced in order to facilitate these more complex models, but the up-scaling methodology remains the same. It is speculated that in these more complex cases, the up-scaling from DEM to CDM will yield even greater increases in computational efficiency.
