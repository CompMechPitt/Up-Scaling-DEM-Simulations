\subsection{DEM Simulations}

The DEM models used in this investigation consisted of a pseudo-random isotropic fracture network which was represented by a Voronoi tessellation. The average block size was specified to be 0.5m using 20 iterations of LLoyd's method (\cite{Lloyd_1982}) in order to achieve a more even size distribution. A 10m x 10m model space was determined to be sufficiently large to represent the rock mass behaviour as an REV. 

A Mohr-Coulomb Plasticity model was used as the constitutive model to describe the behaviour of the intact rock while the joint material behaviour was governed by a Coulomb area slip model. The parameters for the rock and joints were chosen to be representative of a fractured granitic rock mass. The

subject to uniaxial and triaxial testing
procedures (Fig \ref{fig:vorDFN}). The nature of numerical modelling
allows one the luxury of conducting physically impractical material
tests such as direct tensile tests in order to characterize the material
properties of the NFR.

The 10m x 10m model size was determined to be sufficient to represent
the DFN, which was characterized by a Voronoi tessellation with a
block size of approximately 0.5m. Since the material model used in
this investigation can only consider an isotropic NFR, a inherently
isotropic randomly generated Voronoi tessellation was chosen to represent
the DFN in the DEM simulation. The rock and joint properties for the
model, given in Table \ref{tab:demProp}, were chosen to be representative
of a reservoir rock (Pirayehgar and Dusseault, 2015).

The DEM model was subjected to uniaxial tension and compression cycles
as well as triaxial tension and compression cycles under different
confining stresses to calibrate the continuum model. The triaxial
tests were conducted at confining stresses of 5MPa and 10MPa. These
numerical tests were constrained in such a way to imitate the laboratory
testing procedures. The only procedural difference in these virtual
laboratory tests was that the axial strain is brought back to the
initial configuration in order to characterize the damage evolution.

The compression cycles were run at a target strain rate of 0.001/s
for a period of 10s in compression followed by a period of 10s in
tension to return the strain to zero. The transition from the compression
part of the load path to the tension part of the load path was conducted
over a period of 2s to avoid shocking the system.

Because the tension cycles reach failure at a much lower strain, the
tension cycles were run at a target strain rate of 0.0001/s for a
period of 5s in each direction. In this case, the transition period
from tension to compression was 1s.

The aim of the compression and tension cycles is to strain the model
past the yield stress in order to investigate the post-yield behavior,
but not strain the model so much that the RVE loses all of its strength.
It is noted that the strain rate was chosen to be sufficiently small
so as to avoid strain rate effects. The appropriate amount of strain
for a given DEM simulation will depend upon the DEM geometry in addition
