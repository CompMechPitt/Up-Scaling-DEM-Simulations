\section{Distinct Element Method}
The Distinct Element Method (DEM) is a numerical method targeted at modeling discontinuous systems. Discontinuous systems are characterized by the existence of discontinuities that separate discrete domains within the system. In order to effectively model a discontinuous system, it becomes necessary to represent two distinct types of mechanical behaviour: the behaviour of the discontinuities and the behaviour of the solid material.

The behaviour of the discontinuities
