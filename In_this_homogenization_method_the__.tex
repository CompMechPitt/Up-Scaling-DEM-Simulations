%In this homogenization method, the aim is to obtain the spatially averaged stress and strain tensors at any prescribed time. An important aspect of this homogenization method is in the treatment of discontinuities between the blocks. In the case where the blocks become physically separated, there exists voids within the homogenization domain and discontinuities along the homogenization boundary as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:homoboundary}. These discontinuities along the homogenization boundary are important to consider as most of the strain in the model is manifested in theses fractures. To account for these boundary discontinuities, discontinuity boundary segments are added to the homogenization boundary between the corners of the adjacent blocks to account for this strain. Within the homogenization domain, it is important to account for the voids as they are assumed to have a zero stress state, which becomes influential when assessing the homogenized stress tensor.


The homogenization boundary, $\Gamma_{h}$, can be described in terms of $n$ ordered boundary vertices, $V_{i}^{h}=(x_{i}^{h},y_{i}^{h})$, representing the $i$-th set of vertex coordinates along the boundary, such that the area of the homogenization domain, $A^{h}$, can be calculated using the following formulation for the area of an arbitrary, non-self-intersecting polygon \citep{Zwillinger_1995}: 

\begin{equation}
A^{h}=\dfrac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{h}(y_{i+1}^{h}-y_{i-1}^{h})
\label{eqn:hom1}
\end{equation}

%At this point, within the homogenization domain, one must differentiate between the blocks and the void space between the blocks as they have fundamentally different behaviour. As such, the homogenization domain can be decomposed into two mutually exclusive subdomains representing the voids and blocks, $\Omega^{v}$ and $\Omega^{b}$, respectively. The total block area associated with the block subdomain, $A^{b}$, can be assessed as a summation of $m$ block areas within the homogenization domain, while the individual block area can be assessed in a similar manner to (\ref{eqn:hom1}). For $n^{j}$ block boundary vertices, $V_{i,j}^{b}=(x_{i,j}^{b},y_{i,j}^{b})$ representing the $i$th set of vertex coordinates on the $j$th block, the total block area can be calculated as: 

%\begin{equation}
%A^{b}=\dfrac{1}{2}\sum_{j=0}^{m}\sum_{i=1}^{n_{j}}x_{i,j}^{b}(y_{i+1,j}^{b}-y_{i-1,j}^{b})\label{eqn:hom2}
%\end{equation}


%Assuming that the block domain and the void domain are jointly exhaustive of the total homogenization domain, the total area associated with the void subdomain, $A^{v}$, can be written as the difference of the homogenization domain area and the block subdomain area: 

%\begin{equation}
%A^{v}=A^{h}-A^{b}\label{eqn:hom3}
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%A^{v}=\dfrac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{h}(y_{i+1}^{h}-y_{i-1}^{h})-\dfrac{1}{2}\sum_{j=0}^{m}\sum_{i=1}^{n_{j}}x_{i,j}^{b}(y_{i+1,j}^{b}-y_{i-1,j}^{b})\label{eqn:hom4}
%\end{equation}
