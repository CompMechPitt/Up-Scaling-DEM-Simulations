\subsection{DNS Comparison}

A qualitative comparison of the DEM and the CDM model results uses the stress distribution and the surface deflection just before failure. For the DEM solution, since the stress field is discontinuous, the stress fields are smoothed using a cubic spline interpolation and subsequently run through a Gaussian filter with a standard deviation of 2 to reduce the noise in the data set. Figures \ref{fig:S11DNS}, \ref{fig:S22DNS}, and \ref{fig:S12DNS} show the horizontal stress distributions, the vertical stress distributions, and the shear stress distributions, respectively.
