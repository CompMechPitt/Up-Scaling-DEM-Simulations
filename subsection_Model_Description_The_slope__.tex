\subsection{Model Description}

The slope geometry for the slope stability problem was constructed at a height of 30m and a depth of 40m as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:slopeGeom}. This geometry provided enough space to for the failure mechanisms to occur without influence from the boundaries. For this slope, the lateral boundaries had fixed displacements in the x direction, and the bottom boundary had fixed displacements in the y direction. The slope and top boundaries were free.
