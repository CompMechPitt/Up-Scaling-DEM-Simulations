\section{Up-Scaling Methodology}
A goal of the up-scaling methodology is to identify the parameters of a continuum constitutive model that best emulates the response of DEM REV. the up-scaling methodology has five step: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify the DEM RVE for the NFR.
	\item Exercise the  DEM RVE using multiple load paths.
	\item Apply homogenization algorithms to DEM (microscale) results to determine the average (macroscale) stress-strain response of the RVE.
	\item Identify a continuum constitutive model suitable to capture the salient features of NFR mechanics.
	\item Run parameter estimation algorithms to minimize the difference between the CDM and DEM responses.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Identify DEM RVE}
Identifying the appropriate size of an RVE for a given NFR is a challenging task, which is often based on trial and error. Clearly, the RVE should be sufficiently large such that the homogenized stress-strain response for the DEM RVE has converged. In our experience, a safe RVE size for a NFR with non-uniform fracture spacing is about 10 times the average spacing between fractures. The role of RVE size is further investigated below.

\subsection*{Exercise DEM RVE}
The DEM RVE is exercised for different load-paths in a way that is akin  to conducting multiple laboratory tests on physical specimens to characterize the full range of material behaviour. Specifically the mechanical response of NFR depends the degree of confinement and so it is necessary to perform virtual triaxial tests a different levels of confinement. 

\subsection*{Apply homogenization algorithms}
Output from the DEM simulation include the nodal displacements of the deformable blocks between the natural fractures and therefore the normal and tangential crack opening displacements. From the displacements, the microscale stress in the deformable blocks can be determined.  Using these quantities, the average (macroscale) behaviour of the DEM RVE can be  
\subsection*{run parameter estimation algorithms}
In order for this  up-scaling method to be implemented, the CDM model has to be parameterized by identifying key parameters in the constitutive relationships that govern the behavioral response. The general upscaling methodology presented here can be summarized in three steps:


\subsection*{continuum constitutive model)
In dealing with NFR, the behaviour of the rock mass is largely controlled by the discontinuities. If these discontinuities are sufficiently large, as is the case in NFR, one can describe the rock as being in a damaged state. From this perspective, a continuum description of a NFR can be established using Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM). The CDM models capture the salient features of progressive failure and stiffness degradation without the need for an explicit representation of the fracture network. 

\subsection(software implementation)
The upscaling framework that is presented here consists of four main software components (Figure \ref{fig:workflow}). In procedural order, the first software component involved is a DEM simulation package. The DEM software is used to generate the initial dataset which is subsequently fed into the homogenization program to produce the homogenized stress and strain tensors. At this point, the homogenized stress-strain data is used by the parameter estimation software as observation data. The parameter estimation program, using optimization algorithms, iteratively runs single element CDM models attempting a least-squares minimization between the DEM and CDM stress strain curves. Eventually, the algorithm converges to an optimal parameter set that can be said to represent the DEM model in a continuum capcity.

Once the optimal parameter set for the CDM model has been identified, the newly established constitutive model can be used in a Finite Element Method (FEM) code to simulate the response of NFR at the reservoir scale.
