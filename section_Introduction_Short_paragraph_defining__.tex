\section{Introduction}
Short paragraph defining homogenization and how it can be used to development a better understanding of rock mechanics.  Statement about gap in the literature addressed in this article, i.e., not yet applied to HF.

Discussion of the natural fractured rocks as a multiscale material.

Brief discussion of literature describing multiscale modelling methods.  Concurrent vs hierarchical multiscale analysis.  See my review article on my website and \cite{Gracie_2011}. Justify that a hierarchical approach is preferable here, do to long simulated time; concurrent approach is to restrictive in terms of time step size. Also justify/explain selection of homogenization instead of an alternative method (maybe there really isn't an alternative).

Discussion of literature around modeling using homogenization. Continuum to continuum and DEM to Continuum.  What are the common characteristics of the models. What are the unique characteristics of the models.  



Overview of DEM literature with a focus on HF
