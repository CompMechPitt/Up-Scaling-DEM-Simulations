\subsection{Model Description}

The plane-strain slope stability problem has a height of $50m$ and a depth of $80m$ with a $30m$ high slope with a grade of $300\%$ (Figure \ref{fig:slopeGeom}). This geometry provides enough space for the failure mechanisms to occur with little influence from the boundaries. The lateral boundary conditions are zero displacement in the x-direction, and the bottom boundary conditions are zero displacement in the y-direction. The slope and top boundaries are free. A uniformly distributed load was applied over a 5m section on the backslope in a linear incremental fashion until failure.
